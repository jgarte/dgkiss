My personal [GKISS](https://github.com/gkisslinux/grepo) repository.

Some highlights:

- entr
- chrony
- openjdk11-hotspot-bin
- openjdk16-hotspot-bin

Things I need to get around to fixing, or are in an unknown state:

- libslirp
- melonDS (needs libslirp to be fixed up, needs libglvnd to be added)
- tcc
- fftw
- MultiMC (needs GLFW to be fixed up)
- glfw
